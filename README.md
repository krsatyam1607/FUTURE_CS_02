# SECURITY ALERT MONITORING & INCIDENT RESPONSE

## Task 2: Overview
This task involved using the Elastic Stack to monitor and analyze simulated security alerts. The following activities were performed:

- **Log ingestion and parsing using Filebeat and Logstash**
- **Search and filter operations in Kibana**
- **Suspicious activity detection and incident classification**
- **Incident response reporting with evidence and remediation steps**

The setup was conducted on Kali Linux using sample system logs and custom CSV datasets.
## Tools and Environment

This task utilized the Elastic Stack for log analysis and security monitoring. The following components were involved:

- **Elasticsearch**: Core indexing and search engine
- **Logstash**: Ingestion and processing of log data
- **Kibana**: Visualization and log exploration interface
- **Filebeat**: Lightweight log shipper for forwarding logs
- **Log Data**: Custom sample security log in csv format
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux was used for setup and execution

---

This task involved implementing a complete security monitoring workflow using the Elastic Stack. The following activities were performed:

- **Installation and setup of Elastic Stack components on Kali Linux**
- **Log ingestion using Logstash (CSV datasets) and Filebeat (system logs)**
- **Log exploration and detection using Kibana with KQL queries**
- **Suspicious activity detection including brute-force attempts, privilege escalation, and anomalous processes**
- **Incident classification and reporting with evidence, status, and recommendations**
- **Remediation actions including IP blocking, password resets, and SSH hardening**

All steps contributed to generating a structured incident response report.
