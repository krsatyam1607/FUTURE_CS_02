# Tools used for SECURITY ALERT MONITORING & INCIDENT RESPONSE - FUTURE_CS_02

This task involved setting up a SIEM monitoring solution using the Elastic Stack on Kali Linux. The following tools and components were used:

- **Elasticsearch**: Core search engine for indexing and querying log data
- **Logstash**: Ingestion pipeline for parsing and transforming logs from sources like CSV files
- **Kibana**: Web-based UI for visualizing logs, creating dashboards, and analyzing alerts
- **Filebeat**:  Lightweight agent to forward system log data to Logstash or Elasticsearch
- **Log Data**: Included Linux system logs (auth, sudo, syslog) and custom CSV-based simulated events
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux served as the environment for setup and execution
- **Supporting Tools** â€“ Terminal for service management and a web browser for accessing the Kibana interface

All components worked together to simulate a real-world SIEM workflow for monitoring and analyzing security events.
